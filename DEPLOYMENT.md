## Step 1: Get Ready on Your Computer

First, let's make sure everything works on your computer before sharing it with the world.

### 1.1: Open the Terminal

- On Windows: Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
- On Mac: Search for "Terminal" 
- On Linux: Press Ctrl+Alt+T

### 1.2: Go to Your Project Folder

Type `cd` followed by the path to your project. For example:

```sh
cd Documents/personal-portfolio
```

### 1.3: Install Everything You Need

Type this and press Enter:

```sh
npm install
```

Wait until it finishes. You might see some text scrolling by - that's normal!

### 1.4: See Your Website on Your Computer

Type this and press Enter:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Now open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:8080

You should see your website! Click around to make sure everything works.

## Step 2: Put Your Website on GitHub

### 2.1: Create a GitHub Account

If you don't have one already, go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign up.

### 2.2: Create a New Repository

1. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
2. Select "New repository"
3. Name it "personal-portfolio"
4. Choose "Public" 
5. Click "Create repository"

### 2.3: Push Your Code to GitHub

Follow the instructions shown on GitHub after creating your repository. It will be something like:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/personal-portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace "YOUR_USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Deploy Your Website with One Click!

### 3.1: Run the Magic Deployment Script

Type this and press Enter:

```sh
sh deploy.sh
```

### 3.2: Answer the Questions

The script will ask:
1. Your GitHub username - type it in and press Enter
2. The repository name - just press Enter to use "personal-portfolio"

### 3.3: Wait for Deployment

The script is now putting your website on the internet! Wait until you see:
```
âœ… Deployment complete!
```

## Step 4: See Your Website Online

Your website is now available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/personal-portfolio/
```

Replace "YOUR_USERNAME" with your GitHub username.

It might take a few minutes before your website appears online. If you don't see it right away, wait a little bit and try again!

## Troubleshooting: Common Problems

### Problem: "Command not found" errors
Solution: Make sure you installed everything with `npm install` first.

### Problem: Website doesn't show up online
Solution: Wait about 5 minutes and try again. GitHub Pages sometimes takes a little time to update.

### Problem: Website looks broken online
Solution: Make sure your vite.config.ts has the correct base URL for GitHub Pages.

### Problem: Can't refresh pages without getting errors
Solution: Our code already includes a fix for this with the 404.html file. If you're still having issues, double-check that this file was properly deployed.

## Congratulations!
You've just published your very own website on the internet! That's something many adults haven't even done! Now you can share the link with friends and family.
